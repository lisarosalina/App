    Modern drug discoveries are driven by high-throughput screening of candidate drugs but still there are concerns that these drugs fail to perform at clinical stage due to safety issues. Research has shown that pre-screening increases rate of success by filtering out compounds that have undesirable profiles and to select only those fulfil predetermined criteria for quality drug candidates. Virtual screening can be performed using molecular docking approaches. Pain is a significant problem worldwide. In Malaysia chronic pain afflicts the elderly, those residing in rural areas as well as those with no educational background. One of the main treatments for the disease is pharmacological that include opioids. Controversies surrounding the use of opioids emphasises the need for novel non-opioid agents. By building a specialised database for pain-related targets and automating the workflow for virtual screening through an easy-to-use platform then the process for analgesic drug discovery could be further accelerated.
